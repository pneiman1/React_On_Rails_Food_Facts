# Food Nutrition App with a server example on Rails and SQLite3 Db with React doing its isomorphic magic out front.

This project demonstrates using the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node Express API server.

### Node+Express

Check out the [Node+Express](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo) if that's your preferred API server platform.

## Running

```
mo-rails
bundle
cd client
npm i
cd ..
rake start
```

## Overview

`create-react-app` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

To prevent any issues with CORS, the user and her browser will communicate exclusively with the Webpack development server.

Inside `Client.js`, we use Fetch to make a request to the API:

```js
// Inside Client.js
return fetch(`/api/food?q=${query}`, {
  // ...
})
```

This request is made to `localhost:3000`, the Webpack dev server. Because the route has the special prefix `/api/`, the Webpack server knows that this request is actually intended for our API server. We specify in `package.json` that we would like Webpack to proxy API requests to `localhost:3001`:

```js
// Inside client/package.json
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001/",
```

```js
// Example API base URL determination in Client.js
const apiBaseUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'localhost:3001' : '/'
```

This setup uses [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) for process management. Executing `foreman start` instructs Foreman to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.
